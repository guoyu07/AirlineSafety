Node.js! nice server side language to append to the feed so that the client can subscribe.

window object used in pusher-platform.js that makes Node.js impossible atm :(

In the docs it says "More Examples" rather than "More example"?

some hardcoded credentials in the js file:
xhr_1.send("grant_type=client_credentials&credentials=jim"); // FIXME credentials should come from a session cookie or similar

Maybe some more examples of applications where this pattern would useful!

get a js error at the end of getting feed:
index.html:33 Error: Error: Unexpected end to Feed subscription
    at Object.onEnd (pusher-platform.js:364)
    at XMLHttpRequest.Subscription.xhr.onreadystatechange (pusher-platform.js:134)

Would like to delete records from the online dashboard.

Like how it creates a new feed from the js (no need to add to dashboard before hand)

Really like the copy and paste and it works style!

Overall really like the API, nice and simple :) separated front end and backend tasks nicely, we used it as a Queue.
